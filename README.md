# Coulomb Blocade Plots

Program creats an animated gif showing energy levels in a superconducting island with respect to changing of the voltage gate. Based on information from arXiv:1603.08258. Shows coulomb blocade regime.

## Instructions

Running mathematica code will automatically output an animated gif into the folder containging this code. Single plots can be obtained by indexing tableOfPlots[[i]] within the code.

## Caviots/Improvements

for now numberOfEnValsToPlot variable must be odd.

Add a little more thoery/background in this documentation, add equation.
